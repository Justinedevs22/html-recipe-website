<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 (12 to 16 ounce) boneless rib eye steak</li>
    <li>1/2 cup short grain white rice</li>
    <li>3/4 cup water</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons rice vinegar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 cup less-sodium soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon pure maple syrup</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Asian-style chili paste (such as sambal oelek)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon lime zest</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons fresh lime juice</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons wasabi paste, or more to taste</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons furikake seasoning or toasted sesame seeds</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Place the steak on a baking sheet lined with waxed paper. Freeze until it's just firm, approximately 1 hour.</li>
    <li>For the sushi rice, rinse the rice under cold running water, gently rubbing the grains between your fingers. Combine the rice and water in a small saucepan. Bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Simmer the rice covered until it's tender and sticky, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in a mixture of vinegar, sugar, and salt. Let it cool for about 45 minutes.</li>
    <li>While the rice is cooling, thinly slice the steak across the grain into 24 slices about 1/4-inch thick. Transfer the slices to a zip-top bag placed in a shallow dish.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, maple syrup, chili paste, and oil. Pour this mixture over the steak in the bag, seal the bag, and chill it for at least 20 minutes or up to 2 hours.</li>
    <li>For the sauce, whisk together sour cream, lime zest, lime juice, and wasabi paste.</li>
    <li>Shape the cooled rice into 24 oval-shaped portions using wet hands. Drain the marinated steak and discard the marinade. Place the steak on a foil-lined baking sheet set on a wire rack. Use a kitchen torch to char the steak, turning it once, until it reaches the desired doneness, approximately 5 minutes for the entire recipe.</li>
    <li>Place one piece of steak on each portion of rice. Sprinkle with furikake seasoning and serve with the sauce.</li>
